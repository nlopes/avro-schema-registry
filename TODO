- [ ] all errors (low level included) propagate as api errors
  - this looks weird and shouldn't be done this way, it was just easier to move quickly - fix it
  - check error_chain!
- [ ] password as bytes?
- [ ] add /compatibility endpoint
- [ ] change to basic auth to use the newly added basic_auth in actix-web (https://github.com/actix/actix-web/pull/540)
